    <p>
        Hello there!! MENTAL HEALTH is important for EVERYONE, and there is absolutely no shame talking about it.
        This is the place for university students to reach out to each other and chat about whatever is on your mind.
        You can register as a help seeker, a general helper, or a professional helper.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a help seeker, you can choose to show whatever personal information you want. You can indicate your
        university or program if you want to chat with someone with similar experience. You can choose to chat with a
        general helper, who is likely to be a fellow student who is willing to chat with you or a professional helper.
    </p>
